# GAME PITCH

Earth was dying. When humanity finally cracked faster-than-light travel, it felt like salvation—until we realized there was nowhere to go. Every exoplanet within reach was either toxic, barren, or too far.

Then **The Anomaly** appeared.

Not discovered. *Appeared*. A massive wormhole that tore itself into existence just beyond Neptune's orbit. No warning. Just a sudden rupture in space-time that sent gravitational shockwaves rippling through the solar system.

Probes sent through transmitted back impossible readings: a shattered planetary system. Remnants of at least one planet torn apart with enough violence to leave mountain-sized chunks suspended in space. Each fragment somehow retained its atmosphere, held in place by forces that made our physicists question everything.

The mineral composition told the real story: sedimentary layers, fossilized organic matter, geological strata. These weren't constructed habitats. They were *pieces of a world* that had been catastrophically destroyed and somehow preserved.

The civilization that lived here developed technology to manipulate space-time directly. Then something went *catastrophically wrong*. An experiment that tore their planet apart from the inside out and created a permanent rupture in reality. The evidence is everywhere—cities frozen mid-collapse, power systems that cut off in an instant, and always, buried beneath the ruins, pieces of the same technology: the Quantum Looms.

They failed. We found the pieces.

Early salvage operations recovered artifacts found attached to alien remains. Small. Inert. Until human contact.


Contact triggered activation. Suddenly, people could sense matter at the atomic scale—see its structure, reshape it, and assemble raw resources into finished constructs with a thought. What once took hours in a fabricator happened in seconds, as if intention alone could rewrite reality.

These are the **Quantum Looms**: alien interfaces that respond to thought, allowing users to stabilize drifting islands, anchor space, and build everything from defenses to supply lines—directly from base materials, no tools required.

But most Looms are damaged. Rebuilding one means scavenging parts from multiple finds and tuning them for safe neural integration. About half the units from the Fringe fail catastrophically—neural feedback, overload, the occasional unlucky scavenger. But when it works, the transformation is profound: you gain the power to shape the world around you.

Earth's governments mobilized. Corporate fleets, military expeditions, research teams, and millions of desperate colonists poured through what we call **The Threshold**. They had nothing left to lose.

Physics on this side of the wormhole doesn't work right. The closer to The Anomaly, the more stable reality becomes. Venture too far out, and the distortions intensify. Time dilates. Gravity shifts. Laws become flexible.

This isn't a new world. It's a graveyard with machines still running.

The **Safe Zone** near The Anomaly is overcrowded and over-mined, but physics is reliable. New arrivals build shelters on islands that don't drift and make a choice: stay safe and poor, or venture deeper.

The **Outer Rings** hold exotic materials and ancient alien structures, but gravity becomes unpredictable and automated defenses don't distinguish between intruders and archaeologists.

The **Fringe** is where reality stops cooperating. Time doesn't flow consistently. Causality breaks down. The most intact ruins and Quantum Loom fragments are here. Only the best-equipped factions dare to mine the Fringe. Most don't come back. But those who do? They control the system.

You're a **survivor with a choice**.

**Operative**: Spacewalk between warped asteroids with mag-grapples and thruster packs. Infiltrate enemy installations. Plant charges on Quantum Looms and watch their territorial anchors collapse. Stealth, speed, precision.

**Engineer**: Reverse-engineer alien tech. Deploy self-repairing automated systems. Assemble Quantum Looms on resource-rich asteroids and lock them down with overlapping defenses. Let automation do what it does best: never sleep, never miss, never drift.

Operatives can't hold territory without Engineers. Engineers can't defend against skilled infiltration. Factions succeed through coordination—or fall through betrayal.

The asteroids drift. Safe Zone islands eventually reach the Outer Rings. Outer Ring bases slide toward the Fringe. Nothing is permanent unless you anchor it with a Quantum Loom. And even then, Looms can be destroyed.

The technology you need is scattered across dead worlds. Salvage alien machinery. Find Loom fragments in the Fringe. Establish supply chains between asteroid belts. Every material has strategic value. Every island is contested.

This isn't about rebuilding civilization. It's about who controls the alien legacy left behind.

The Anomaly is waiting. The Fringe holds answers. In the cold vacuum of warped space, only the prepared survive.

## WHAT IS THIS?

A sci-fi multiplayer sandbox where you're a survivor in a shattered star system orbiting a collapsing spatial anomaly. Start in the Safe Zone near the center where physics is stable, then venture into the dangerous Outer Rings and reality-warping Fringe for richer resources and alien technology. Salvage **Quantum Loom** fragments—ancient devices that anchor territory and enable automation. Play as a high-mobility Operative specializing in sabotage and Fringe exploration, or as an Engineer who builds self-sustaining automated fortresses. No respawns without clone bays. No safety without preparation. No territory without Looms. Just cold physics, colder vacuum, and the question—how far into The Anomaly's influence will you risk for power?
