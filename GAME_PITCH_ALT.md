# GAME PITCH (ALT VERSION)

Earth was dying—slowly, inevitably, choked by our own industry and neglect. We poisoned the air, stripped the land, and watched the oceans turn toxic. We did figure out FTL. Too bad we didn't have enough fuel to get anywhere.

When hope finally came, it wasn’t a new world—it was a wound in space. The Anomaly, a wormhole that appeared without warning beyond Neptune. Probes found fragments of a desolated planet, torn apart in instant. Then the first explorers decided to cross.

Most believe the wormhole itself was the result of the aliens’ final experiment gone wrong—the same disaster that shattered their world and left the system in ruins. And it was in those ruins we found what they left behind: cities frozen in collapse, power grids cut in an instant, and everywhere, fragments of incomprehensible technology—most importantly, the Quantum Looms. Most were broken, inert, missing pieces. Half failed on activation. Bad day for the occasional unlucky scavenger. But when one worked, everything changed.

Contact with a working Loom rewrote the rules. Instantly, users could sense matter at the atomic scale. Reshape it. Assemble resources into finished constructs with a thought. Fabrication became instant. The Looms let us anchor drifting islands, stabilize space, and build everything from defenses to supply lines instantly—no tools, just willpower.

Earth’s governments, corporations, and millions of desperate colonists poured through what became known as the Threshold. At first, everything seemed normal on the other side—gravity, time, even the air felt familiar. It wasn’t until the first expeditions pushed further out that we realized the truth: the deeper you go, the less the rules apply. Time stretches and snaps, gravity twists, and the laws of nature become unpredictable. We're not sure if the alien tech was stabilizing things, or perhaps physics itself was bleeding through from our side.

Factions quickly formed—some backed by nations, others by corporations, and plenty by desperate survivors banding together for a shot at power. The Safe Zone near the Anomaly is stable but overcrowded, a patchwork of fortified enclaves and uneasy truces. Beyond that, the Outer Rings offer rare materials and ancient structures, but also unpredictable hazards and automated defenses. The Fringe is pure chaos: reality breaks down, ruins float in impossible orbits, and the best rewards—and greatest risks—await those willing to gamble everything.

You’re a survivor with a choice:

**Operative**: Spacewalk between warped asteroids, infiltrate enemy strongholds, sabotage Looms, and vanish before reality collapses. Stealth, speed, precision.

**Engineer**: Reverse-engineer alien tech, deploy automated defenses, and anchor territory with Looms. Build, automate, and outlast.

Neither can win alone. Operatives need Engineers to hold ground. Engineers need Operatives to break enemy lines. Factions rise and fall by coordination—or betrayal.

Asteroids drift. Safe Zone islands slide outward. Nothing is permanent unless you anchor it with a Loom—and even then, nothing lasts forever. Salvage, build, and fight for every inch. The Anomaly is waiting. The Fringe holds answers. In the cold vacuum of warped space, only the prepared survive.

## WHAT IS THIS?

A sci-fi multiplayer sandbox: survive in a shattered star system orbiting a collapsing anomaly. Start in the Safe Zone, venture into the Outer Rings and Fringe for resources and alien tech. Salvage Quantum Looms—devices that anchor territory and enable automation. Play as a high-mobility Operative or a fortress-building Engineer. No respawns without clone bays. No safety without preparation. No territory without Looms. Just cold physics, colder vacuum, and the question—how far into The Anomaly’s influence will you risk for power?
